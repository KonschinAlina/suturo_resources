		\todo{Do we mention the room already being mapped here}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The demonstration will happen with the actual hsr robot, not in a simulated envoirment.
			\item The HSR robot stands in the room directly in front of the entrance door.
			\item Somewhere in the room, maybe on a table or on the ground, is an object that wasn't there when mapping the room.
			\item There is only exactly one misplaced item.
			\item The item is big enough for the HSR to grasp and in a reachable location.
			\item A basket is placed in a know position inside the room.
