	In the context of the bachelorproject 'Suturo', we have the chance to work with the HSR robot from Toyota. Our goal is to create an intelligent software and compete in the Robocup@home competition in April 2020. 
	In order to achieve this goal, we are currently working on presenting our second demonstration, which will showcase our take on the challenge (Clean Up) that we have chosen to compete in. What exactly our take on the challenge looks like will be elaborated further down in the documentation.
	In the following segments we will mainly focus on method, goal, and current achievements of the project in general and it's subgroups.
