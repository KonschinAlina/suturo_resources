	In the context of the SUTURO bachelorproject, we have the chance to work with the HSR robot from Toyota. Our goal is to create an intelligent software and compete in the Robocup@home competition in April 2020. 
	In the previous milestone we focused on the 'Storing Groceries' challenge, which was the one the previous team competed in. In this milestone we will be focusing on both challenges that we want to participate in, the challenges being; Storing Groceries and Clean Up. 
	In the following segments we will explain the current architecture, we will list the plan that we worked out for the demonstration. The documantation will further include the achievements of the subgroups.
