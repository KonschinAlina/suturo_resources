	Despite facing many problems, we managed to achieve our Main Goal.
	Using our Software the HSR is able to correctly identify the Pringles Can it is supposed to move.
	Furthermore the HSR is able to navigate to the Pringles Can and is able to move it.
	Since we now have a functioning base and many problems solved, we can now develop our Software further, to complete the clean up challenge and to solve different problems.
