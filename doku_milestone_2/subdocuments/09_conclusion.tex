	There was both positive and negative feedback for the second milestone of the SUTURO group. Some positve things were that almost all goals were reached and that the communication within and between the differents groups went much better. Some negative things were that  the deadlines were often missed, and the distribution of the tasks uneven. Another thing was that there was a great struggle with the spontaneous demonstration the group had to do a few weeks back. 
The demonstration today, on the 6th of March, on the otherhand went rather smoothly. The only thing that could be mentioned is that the HSR missed the object and a group member had to adjust the object on the second try.
