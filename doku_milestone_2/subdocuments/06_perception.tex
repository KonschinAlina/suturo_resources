		The main changes and improvements upon the status presented at milestone 1 are the following: Perception now runs inside an actionserver, in contrast to 				plain robosherlock. Additionally, Caffe is now used for feature extraction, and KNN is used for the classification of detected objects. We also recorded 				image data of objects available to us, which were then used for classification purposes.
