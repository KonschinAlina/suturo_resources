		\section{Planning:}
		The task that Planning is focusing on that the moment is the integration of the interfaces and communication from and between the different groups. The group is also responsible for the errorhandling, which means that they act as a middle-man between groups in order to gain access to all sides, which makes it easier to identify and correct possible errors.
		
		\section{Perception:}
		
		
		\section{Manipulation:}
		
		
		\section{Knowledge:}
		The Knowledgebase has been implemented rather early on in this Milestone, it being one of the highest priorities. We still need to implement a few things but those are minor, and the Knowledge part of the SUTURO project will be able to be showcased in the second Milestone. 
		
		\section{NLP:}
		Albeit this part of the project has not been fully included in the robot yet, there has been progress. There are commands which start and stop the current task the robot is doing, being "Robot start" and "Robot stop". Currently there are still some changes that need to be made to make this feature fully functional. NLP is also focusing on readying the output that the HSR is supposed to give in certain situations. An Elaboration on this topic follows later in the NLP section of the documentation.
