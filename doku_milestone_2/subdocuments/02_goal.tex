    There were quite a few goals that were supposed to be implemented for the second milestone; the most important one being to integrate the knowledge base. The knowledge base itself should have abilities to locate objects in a room and give information about that object. Some of these information would for example be: Where is it supposed to go, what is it, and what category does it belong to.
    Other goals were the scanning of the room, put items into the shelf, condition-based planes, object recognition, different gripping positions, create a giskard world, natural language generation, and simple voiced commands, classification of data, and the region filter. 
    Five of those general goals were marked as important, those being: the integration of the knowledge base, the condition-based planes, the object recognition, the different gripping positions and the classification of data. All those five goals were reached, so were most of the others. The simple voiced commands only work in theory so far, since the confidence is too high, and the program stops just after it starts. Natural language generation is not fully finished yet but will be up and running for the next milestone.
