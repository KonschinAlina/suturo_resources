The main goals for milestone 3 were to finalize the Clean Up challenge and all sub goals needed to accomplish that task, to improve the plans of execution, to fix various Bugs that had emerged in milestone 2, to implement the required safety check for both challenges and to integrate NLP, which had been a standalone feature so far.\\
There were also some other goals like identifying and opening doors, that were deemed "nice to have" because they were not essential to complete the Clean Up and Storing Groceries tasks.\\
Due to the Coronavirus situation a new priority goal became necessary at the beginning of the milestone, which was to make everything work in the GAZEBO simulation environment instead of the HSR.
