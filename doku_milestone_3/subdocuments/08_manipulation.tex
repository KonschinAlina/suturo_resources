	The main focus in this milestone was on improving the existing code from the milestones before and make a version of manipulation which works well in the simulation.\\
	So a big part of time was used to rework the scripts and the code for gazebo.\\
	On the other hand we fixed some bugs to develop a smoother experience. We improve the collision handling while grasping and placing. For that we specified a area around the gripper, which shouldn't touch any surfaces or objects, accept for the object we want to grasp.\\
	We also add waypoints to prevent collision with the shelf by grasping or placing.\\
	In milestone three we had a bug, which cause that we sometimes dropped objects in front of the shelf, but returning success as result. We preventing this now by compare the goal coordinates with the current coordinates. Currently this code is on a seperated branch.\\
	In the thrid milestone we've finished the take\_pose\_server. Please see chapter 10.1 in the final report for the method documentation.\\
	We add a function to the grasp\_object\_server, which allows to move to transport\_pose and close the gripper. This is usefull in case we can't grasp an object by ourself but want to sorted in the shelf or put it in the bucket for "clean up". In order to this we made a big refactor in the grasp\_object\_server, so this feature is currently not in master, but you can see the documentation for it in the final report at chapter 10.0.2.
	We also finished the place\_server. You can see the documentation for it in the final report under chapter 10.2. You should also look at chapter 10.3 for the object\_state\_listener and 10.4 for giskard\_load\_static\_objects.\\
	Another goal at this mileston was to open room doors and shelf doors. Because of the current situation we decided to focus on shelf doors first. We've decided to do that with the constraint feature of giskard for a smooth sequence of events. Unfortunately we had some issues with testing at this point . So we don't integraded this feature in milestone 3.\\
	We have discard our goal to check for an object in gripper with the hand camera. The reasons for that were, that we had a good function for this in grasp\_object\_server alreadey and we dont need this feature in the simulation, because we dont have any inaccuracies there.
