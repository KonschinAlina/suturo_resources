This is the documentation for the third and final Milestone of the SUTURO project. Because of the Corona virus, the group wasn't able to go to the lab and demonstrate their accomplishments with the real robot, but managed to do it virtually instead.\\
One of the goals that was set for this Milestone was the improvement of the code quality, and a guidebook along with the documentation, where the group put up an installation guide.\\
In the following sections, every group will go through the work they did in the Milestone, elaborating on the architecture, code, and software.
