This is the documentation for the final Milestone of the SUTURO project. Because of the Corona virus, the group wasn't able to go to the lab and demonstrate their accomplishments with the real robot, but managed to do it virtually instead.\\
The goal of the project was competing in the RoboCup. This was cut short, since the competition was cancelled because of the virus. The group planned to compete in two categories; storing groceries and clean-up. Instead of competing, the group will now present the tasks virtually in front of the tutors. This will be further elaborate on in one of the following sections.\\
In the following sections, every group will go through the work they did in the Milestone, elaborating on the architecture, code, and software.
