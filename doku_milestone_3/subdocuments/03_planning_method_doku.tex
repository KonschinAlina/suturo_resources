	  	\begin{itemize}
			\item execute-cleanup \\
			main function for the clean up task when this function is called it starts all the subroutines to execute the planned behaiior for this task
			\item shelf-scan \\
			perceives the entire shelf using perceive-shelf
			\item perceive-shelf\\
			same as in grocery perceives the shelf depending on the given regions value
			\item perceive-table \\
			same as in grocery perceives the robocub table
			\item transport \\
            transports all objects found on the robocub table and then places them into the shelf
			\item point-of-interest-search \\
			moves to a point of interest and perceives it 
			\item point-of-interest-transport \\
			grasp objects found with point of interest search and places them into the shelf
			\item grasp-with-failure-handling-floor \\
			grasping with failure handling it falls to grasp an object from the floor
			\item grasp-handling\\
			grasping with primitive failture handling for grasping from the robocub table
