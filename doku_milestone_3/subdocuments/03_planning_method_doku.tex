		\section{GROCERY}
		
		\subsection{execute-grocery.lisp}
		This file contains the main function for this tasks and some subroutines.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{execute-grocery} \\
			This is the main function for the grocery storing task, when this function is called it starts all subroutines to execute the planned behavior for this task, including failure handling
			\item \textbf{perceive-shelf} \\
			This function is a subroutine for perceiving shelfs depending on the given region value
			\item \textbf{perceive-table} \\
			This function is a subroutine for perceiving the table depending on the table position given by the knowledge base
			\item \textbf{grasp-handling} \\
			This function is a subroutine for grasping objects with primitive failure handling, which object will be grasped is determined by the knowledge base
			\item \textbf{grasp-with-failure-handling} \\

	    This function moves the robot to the table position which is determined by the knowledge base, it takes a boolean value which defines if the robot should be in perceiving or placing/grasping base pose at the goal position (nil = grasping/placing, T = perceiving) 
	    \item \textbf{move-to-shelf} \\
	    This function moves the robot to the shelf position which is determined by the knowledge base, it takes a boolean value which defines if the robot should be in perceiving or placing/grasping base pose at the goal position (nil = grasping/placing, T = perceiving)
