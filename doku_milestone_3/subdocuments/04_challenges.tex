\section{General}

While we were working on this milestones goals, we had to change our way of working completely, because of the COVID-19 outbreak.
We could not work with the robot anymore and the robocup got cancelled. This lead to a huge loss of motivation, since we lost our maingoal and could not personally work together anymore.
The situation forced us to work in a simulation. We had to set up a fitting simulation environment and find a way to properly integrate and test our system from home. This did cost a lot of time, where we were not able to properly work on the project.
These changes had some positive sideeffects. Since we worked from home, it was easier to find someone who was able to help, when we encountered some problem. Most of the time we worked on one computer, which lead to an better overview over the work and the problems of other groups.

\section{Manipulation}

The manipulation group worked a lot with the robot, which worked well, since the communication and teamwork was good.
Because of that they were strongly affected by the changes made due to COVID-19. After the work with the robot was not possible anymore a lot of motivation was lost.

\section{Knowledge}

A clear division of tasks lead to good teamwork and easier communication in the knowledge group.
The changes made due to the COVID-19 outbreak, did not affect the knowledge group as much as the other groups, since they did not have to work as closely with the robot.

\section{Planning}

The COVID-19 changes made the work for planning really hard, since they worked close to the robot. Because of that they could not really work while the changes were made and had to adapt to the new situation, which took some time.
This lead to a loss in motivation. Despite that the group work did function well, with good communication and clear division of tasks.

\section{Perception}

The teamwork and communication worked well, despite COVID-19. Although the changing working and environmental conditions lead to a loss of motivation.
