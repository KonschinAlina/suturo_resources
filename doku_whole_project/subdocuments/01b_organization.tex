	\section{Model of Development}
	The procedure model is a custom scrum variation. Instead of the fixed sprint length we decided to adjust the length of each sprint as needed. Additionally the daily stand ups have been omitted, since the project only has a 16 hour per week workload.
	
	Each Friday a meeting with the tutors was held where we presented the current progress, discussed further strategies and clarified organizational matters.
	
	In addition an internal meeting was be held each Friday discussing the internal organization and integrating the progress of the different sub groups.
	
	\textbf{TODO: Create diagram of procedure model and add here}
