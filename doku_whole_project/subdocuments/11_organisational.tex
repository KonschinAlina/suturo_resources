		\section{Team}
		We tried to organize our work using Scrum and tools like Trello. But in the end we did not stick to strict patterns and rather used these as we saw fit for the given situation. This was partly caused by lacking experience, as we could not properly estimate how long it would take to create or test a feature and did not have a lot of experience working on a project like this.
		While integrating we sometimes encountered problems, whith parts of other groups. Because of this we made an agreement, that at least one person of each group has to be around. Since that person has a better overview over the work of the other groups and has less time for his work it would probably be benefical to work out a proper system next time.

		\section{Corona}
	  	While we were working on Milestone 3, we had to make major changes due to the Corona outbreak. The implementation of these changes did cost us some time. During this time it was hard for some to work at all, since they worked closely with the robot, which was not possible.
	  	Especially for the groups, that worked close to the robot, the changes lead to a huge loss of motivation.
	  	Despite that we managed to properly organise our work and got a lot done.
	  	Since we now worked on one project computer we even got an better overview over the work of the other groups and it was easier to get help, after encountering a problem, since everyone worked from home.
