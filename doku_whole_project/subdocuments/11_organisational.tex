	  	While we were working on Milestone 3, we had to make major changes due to the Corona outbreak. The implementation of these changes did cost us some time. During this time it was hard for some to work at all, since they worked closely with the robot, which was not possible.
	  	Especially for the groups, that worked close to the robot, the changes lead to a huge loss of motivation.
	  	Despite that we managed to properly organise our work and got a lot done.
	  	Since we now worked on one project computer we even got an better overview over the work of the other groups and it was easier to get help, after encountering a problem, since everyone worked from home.
