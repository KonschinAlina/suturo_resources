	\section{Introduction}
	This document describes how to install the different parts of our system.
	
	\subsection{prerequisites}
	
	For our system you will need \textbf{Ubuntu 16.04}.\\
	Furthermore Ros-Kinetic is needed. Instructions on how to install Ros can be found \href{http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu}{here}. It is recommended to install the Desktop-Full version.\\
	You also have to setup your PC for the use of the HSR.
	A description on how to do that can be found \href{https://docs.hsr.io/manual_en/howto/pc_install.html}{here}\\
	The catkin\_tools package also needs to be installed. You find the instructions on how to install it \href{https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html}{here}.\\
	To follow this guide you will also need python-wstool.
	You can install it by running this command:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-wstool
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\subsection{create a workspace}
	The first step is to open the directory where you want to create the workspace.\\
	Now run the following commands.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
	\item mkdir -p YOURWORKSPACENAME/src
	\item cd YOURWORKSPACENAME/
	\item catkin build 
	\end{itemize}
	
	To load the environment of a workspace, you can run the command:
	\begin{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
	in your workspace.
