	\subsection{Workspaces}
	\subsubsection{Manipulation}
	It is known, that some messages can cause problems between Manipulation and Knowledge. Because of this we installed Manipulation in a different workspace.
	
	\subsubsection{Planning}
	If you want to install Planning in the same workspace as the other parts, the hsr\_description package should cause problems. To solve this issue we use a separate workspace for Planning.
	

	\subsection{Knowledge}
	\subsubsection{Gradle}
	Sometimes while building Knowledge, gradle does cause problems.
	If that happens it usually can be fixed by deleting the .gradle folder in your home folder.
	
	\subsection{Manipulation}
	\subsubsection{Python dependencies}
	If you encounter problems, while installing the python packages you can try to update pip by running:
	\begin{lstlisting}
sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
\end{lstlisting}
