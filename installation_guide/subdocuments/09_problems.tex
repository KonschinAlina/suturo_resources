	\section{Known problems}

	\subsection{Workspaces}
	\subsubsection{Manipulation}
	It is known, that some messages can cause problems between Manipulation and Knowledge. Because of this we installed Manipulation in a different workspace.
	
	\subsubsection{Planning}
	If you want to install Planning in the same workspace as the other parts, the hsr\_description package should cause problems. To solve this issue we use a separate workspace for Planning.
	

	\subsection{Knowledge}
	\subsubsection{Gradle}
	Sometimes while building Knowledge, gradle causes problems.
	If that happens it usually can be fixed by deleting the .gradle folder in your home folder.
	
	\subsubsection{Ros-mongodb\_log}
	Running the \\
	\begin{lstlisting}
rosdep install
\end{lstlisting}
command in a workspace with Knowledge can cause problems with the package ros-mongodb\_log. To solve this you can use the option -r of the \\
\begin{lstlisting}
rosdep install
\end{lstlisting}
command.\\
Should you encounter further problems it is possible, that you need to install the  python packages rrdtool and pymongo. You can install these by running:\\
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt-get install python-rrdtool python-pymongo
\end{lstlisting}

	\subsubsection{Ros-kinetic-rosjava-buildtools}
	While running the rosdep install command, it is possible that the ros-kinetic-rosjava-buildtools package cannot be installed and an error occurs. In that case running the command again should fix the problem.


	\subsection{NLP}
	\subsubsection{Sling}
	While installing sling, it is possible that an error occurs, that says the file requirements.txt is missing. In that case you can try downloading sling \href{https://pypi.org/project/sling/#files}{here}. After downloading it extract the files, open sling-0.1.0/sling.egg-info and copy the requires.txt file into sling-0.1.0. Rename it to requirements.txt and open the folder, where you extracted the files. Then run \\
	\begin{lstlisting}
sudo -H pip3 install sling-0.1.0/
sudo -H pip3 install simplenlg tinyrpc==0.9.4 zmq
\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Manipulation}
	\subsubsection{Python dependencies}
	If you encounter problems, while installing the python packages you can try to update pip by running:\\
	\begin{lstlisting}
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
\end{lstlisting}
